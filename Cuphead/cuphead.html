	  <p class="p1">According to The Verge, Cuphead, created by MDHR studios, is an indie side-scrolling run-and-gun/boss rush game that incorporates the 1930s rubber hose style of animation for its visuals and old-style big band jazz for its music. The game was completely hand-drawn to emulate to process that was used back in the day. Everything in the game was hand-drawn, then scanned and colored in photoshop</p>

<p class="p2" class: p2>The development team purchased stacks upon stacks of animation paper for the game which ended up only lasting about 1/3 of the way through the development process due to the dramatically expanding scope of the game part eay through development. According to an Interview that Cuphead's lead Artist Chad Moldenhauer did with Time Magazine, Cuphead is animated "on ones" or at 24 frames per second. This is very resource intensive, but creates a very smooth animation style that works well for gameplay.</p>
<p class="p3" class: p2><em>Fun Fact: If you play a level and listen to the solo section of the tune, then play the level again, you will hear a different solo each time! This is because they had so many extra takes of the tunes in the studio that they decided to not let them go to waste.</em></p>
