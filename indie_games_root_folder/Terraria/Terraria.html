		<h2>Terraria&nbsp;</h2>
		<h3>By: Keegan Gephart</h3>
		<p class="p1">Terraria is a game developed by the company Relogic who has developed unique and versatile art direction for said game. Terraria’s art style would be placed into the general category of pixel art. There are many indie games like Terraria that utilize this art style. In certain ways Terraria’s sprites feel very different from other games that incorporate pixel art. There are three aspects of the game that really show Terraria’s excellence when it comes to its art style. These three categories include tool, NPC, and block sprites which helps give Terraria its identity. Due to Relogic’s dedication to making Terraria fans happy they have rolled out many updates to add a lot more of each subject showing some form of evolution. &nbsp;</p>

	<p class="p2" class: p2>Terraria has had many tools such as weapons, pickaxes, axe’s and more constantly added in every major update. There have been iconic swords that have been in the game for a long time such as the Terra Blade which shoots sword projectiles. In the most recent update for Terraria it has gotten a visual rework alongside the swords that make it up so that their swings and sword beams do not look as boring (show side by side comparison of old and new animations). Another iconic Terraria weapon that has a well-executed animation is the Zenith. It has it’s own custom swing animation that uses the sprites of other major swords in the game such as the Terra Blade. There are other tools besides swords that can make the game look better through building.</p>

	  Terraria has many different tools to build with such as the pickaxes that can help gather materials and change the space of the game. Out of these there are blocks, walls, furniture pieces, and paint that really stand out. These different elements allow for player’s to create their own art by using the art (building items) that Relogic has provided them. Blocks allow for some manipulation of depth, dimension, texture and color. Additionally blocks can be hammered into corners and slopes to create more smooth structures which adds even more depth to building. This is just a fraction of what’s needed to make a nice-looking building in Terraria. One other aspect of building, walls, allows for friendly NPCs to move in and prevents monsters from spawning inside. Outside of it’s practical use it can be used alongside blocks to create depth as it is closer to a background element than normal solid blocks. There are many kinds of walls that can be used in multiple different scenarios. Fences are a type of wall that can be used to look like fences, old windows that do not use glass, and pillars/stilts that hold up structures. This means that the fences are a very versatile kind of wall that can be used to add small but impactful detail to a structure a player builds. Both walls and blocks can be even further detailed with paint. There are basic colors of paint which can be used to change the colors of both blocks and walls but keeps the texture of them. This can be useful for creating details like shadows by using black paint or creating a custom tree in spring by coloring the leaves pink. Paint is used to make more advanced pieces of art giving more power to builders. With the many options in Terraria players can enjoy creating cool buildings.

 <p class="p2" class: p2>The other aspect that gives Terraria its identity are the entities in the game, more specifically Non-Playable Characters. These consists of both hostile and non-hostile enemies. The Hostile NPCs consists of normal enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses. The designs of each of these hostile get bigger and more complex in relation to if they are a notable foe. This means that most bosses will have a higher pixel count due to their larger size. One iconic boss that has a lot of detail is the Eye of Cthulhu. Due to the fact that the eye of Cthulhu has two phases it gets two sprites. As the second phase starts it changes and becomes gorey by removing its front showing teeth underneath. This boss well represents the boss sprites of Terraria as it is likely the first boss a new player would encounter. Another well designed enemy is the voodoo demon which carries around the voodoo doll of the guide npc. The overall design is creative as a smaller version of the guide is incorporated into the demon which helps hint at how to progress the game in the underworld. The most well-known friendly NPC is the guide who will spawn along side the player as a new world is created. His design is simple compared to the other friendly NPCs giving an unassuming and non-aggressive feeling to new players. Due to this he is seen as the face of all of the NPCs.

  Terraria’s art direction sets itself apart from other pixel art games through its execution and how players interact with it. There are icon weapons from Terraria that look unique such as the Terra Blade and the Zenith. Blocks, walls and the paint all allow for immense building options in Terraria allowing for more player interaction outside of combat and exploring. Terraria’s Non-playable characters also emits thoughtful designs as well to fit the feel of the game. Overall the art direction was very well handcrafted by the likes of Relogic.
